This video shows,  how PID controller can be optimized for a customized objective performance index (e.g. ITAE) in MATLAB using MATLAB's Genetic Algorithm tool.

** UPDATE:- about compatibility/handling a minor glitch due to certain changes in recent versions of MATLAB**

In recent versions of MATLAB (version 2019b and later), you may be getting a structure kind of output such as out.ITAE rather than simply ITAE, as explained in this video. To fix the issue, you can do the following:
1. Export the ITAE data as a .MAT file. to do this: go to "library browser" and then to "sinks"
2. Drag and drop 'To file' block to your SIMULINK block diagram.
3. Rename the file name as 'ITAE' and change the save format to 'array'.
4. To access this file and ITAE value in your MATLAB function, use the following code:
ITAE = load('ITAE.mat');
num_samples = size(ITAE.ans , 2);
ITAE_value = ITAE.ans(2, num_samples);
cost = ITAE_values(num_samples);
Rest of the code will remain same as in the video. 
Hope this helps...
